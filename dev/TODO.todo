    a) Remove sectra and frequency lists from naming convention    OK
    b) Remove parameter section from d_config.py?                  OK

1. validate spectrum
    a) check why errorbars are so large
    b) add tf plotting to draw module                              OK
    
2. validate smica
    a) take consistent simulation data as input                    OK
           check data                                              OK
    b) make synmaps from smica data?
    c) derive transferfunction, for both, combined cmb, and cmb-per-detector?
    d) crosscorrelation/covariance on maplevel or ratio on cl level?
           currently, ratio on cl level                            OK
    e) cleanup last couple of steps of the pipeline

3. add everything to cmb-skypatch package
    check if cmb-skypatch still works                              OK
    add                                                            OK
    take noise variance maps from dx12 .fits files                 OK
    derive analytic result for variance when combining patches with predefined weights
    calculate correct fsky in `Lib_emp`
    apply smica on each patch, then calculate approx_variance_min_ma?

4. smica
    fix singular matrix error                                   OK
    get it to run for ell>2000 (it's LFI cut-off)               OK
        works now, as long as LFI input is turned off (dim of gal components: 6->3)
